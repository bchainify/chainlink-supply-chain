## Inspiration
>  We envision a world where individuals and businesses can sell goods and services they own, make or build in a peer-to-peer token economy with Chainlink's secure blockchain middleware using Oracles that act as a bridge between smart contracts and off-chain data feeds.  We want to empower underrepresented people and economies worldwide with our peer-to-peer fairtrade blockchain marketplace.   We are a global team and have traveled and lived in many countries where the local communities and families will benefit from our solution.  

## What it does
Our project is a Frontend **Market-on-Chain** dApp and supply chain inventory management solution using Chainlink Oracles to pull in product information from multiple off-chain data sources including:

* GS1 US Data Hub Universal Product Code (UPC)
The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and many other countries generally use barcodes known as Universal Product Codes (UPCs).

* Global Trade Identifier (GTIN13)
The GTIN is a globally unique 14-digit number used to identify trade items, products, or services. GTIN is also an umbrella term that refers to the entire family of UCC.
International Article Number (EAN) & EAN13 (European Article Number an extension of UPC)
Merchants in Europe and other areas around the world often use a barcode type known as an International Article Number (EAN, since it was formerly known as European Article Number).

* International Standard Book Number (ISBN)
Books often use the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) barcode format, which is compatible with EAN barcodes.

* Amazon (ASIN)
Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a ten-digit alphanumeric code that identifies products on Amazon. It's unique for each product and is assigned when you create a new product in Amazon's catalog.

And many more.... Our solution also aims to support custom off-chain data sources to create custom QR-Codes with information for the product or good using a non-fungible-tokens (NFT) for DApps running on Chainlink.
